# Intensive Gaming

Intensive Gaming was the 1st Web project I ever attempted. My knowledge was limited and my understanding was non-existing at the time. It featured the use of the Front-End CSS framework Bootstrap (v3). In my attempt to build the project to meet the user requirements for my college project I succeeded achieving a Distinction in the assignment as well as the entire unit.

I hope to keep this repository as a reference as my starting point. So that, I can refer to it in the years to follow of how I've advanced.

As a final note, I'd like to offer some advise to new web developers. Avoid any frameworks or libraries when learning the technologies of the web. I made the mistake of diving into technologies like Bootstrap and jQuery early in my learning curve and in doing so I found it harder to understand the basics to the technologies. That being said, don't avoid them completely. They make for amazing RAD (Rapid Application Development) as well as understanding CSS better. Just try to learn the basics through plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript first.
